# Web Page Analyzer

Is a simple web application built in Go that allows users to analyze web pages/URLs and retrieve details about the structure and contents.
it performs below tasks,
- Detects the HTML version of the page.
- Extracts the title of the page.
- Counts the number of headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc.) on the page.
- Analyzes internal and external links, reporting inaccessible links as well.
- Checks if the page contains a login form.

The application allows users to input a URL through a web interface and returns an analysis of the page.

## Possible Improvements

- Use Goroutines to parellelize data extraction from html document like title, links etc. Responsiveness
- Pooling workers for accessible link check.
- Data Persistance/Caching for history & Performance. 

- Streaming API response. some fetch are easy compare check broken links. to improve user experience, we can stream data from API.
- FrontEnd Improvements. e.g: React or Styling.
- Include Page Performance metrics. e.g: latency, load time.
- CI/CD for this Project. e.g: Automated build, test(+static-sonar) and deploy.
- Load balancing and distribute requests.
